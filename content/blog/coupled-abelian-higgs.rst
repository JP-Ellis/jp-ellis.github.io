The Abelian Higgs model is perhaps the simplest example of spontaneous symmetry
breaking which gives mass to the boson.  The Lagrangian is given by

\\begin{equation}
\\mathscr{L} = - \\frac{1}{4} F_{\\mu\\nu}^{2} + \| \\partial_{\\mu} \\phi + i e A_{\\mu} \\phi \| + m^{2} \|\\phi\|^2 - \\lambda \|\\phi\|^{4};
\\end{equation}

however, I am interested in the next simplest scenario which involves two Higgs
charged under the same gauge symmetry.  The Lagrangian becomes:

\\begin{align}
\\mathscr{L} = - \\frac{1}{4} F_{\\mu\\nu}^{2} + \| \\partial_{\\mu} \\phi_{1} + i e_{1} A_{\\mu} \\phi_{1} \| + m_{1}^{2} \|\\phi_{1}\|^2 - \\lambda \|\\phi\|^{4};
\\end{align}
