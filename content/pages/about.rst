I'm a PhD candidate at `The University of Melbourne <https://unimelb.edu.au>`_,
working under the supervision of Prof. Volkas.

In additional to physics, I enjoy working on some `side projects
<{filename}projects.rst>`_ which may or may not be related to physics.  On such
side-project is `Ti*k*Z-Feynman <{filename}projects/tikz-feynman.rst>` which
allows for Feynman diagrams to be drawn entirely within LaTeX.
