My name's Joshua Ellis.  I study at `The University of Melbourne
<https://unimelb.edu.au>`_, currently completing a masters in the theoretical
particle physics group.

When I procrastinate, I usually end up starting other `side projects
<{filename}projects.rst>`_ and this blog is one of these side projects.  I
intend to write small articles whenever my procrastination results something
mildly useful or interesting.
