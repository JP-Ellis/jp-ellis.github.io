My name's Joshua Ellis.  I study at `The University of Melbourne
<https://unimelb.edu.au>`_, currently completing a masters in the theoretical
particle physics group.

When I procrastinate, I usually end up starting other side projects and this
blog is one of these side projects.  I intend to write small articles whenever
my procrastination results something mildly useful or interesting.
