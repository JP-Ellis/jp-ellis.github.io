I'm a PhD candidate at [The University of Melbourne](https://unimelb.edu.au),
working under the supervision of Prof. Volkas.

In additional to physics, I enjoy working on
some [side projects]({filename}projects.md) which may or may not be related to
physics.  On such side-project
is [Ti*k*Z-Feynman]({filename}projects/tikz-feynman.md) which allows for Feynman
diagrams to be drawn entirely within LaTeX.
